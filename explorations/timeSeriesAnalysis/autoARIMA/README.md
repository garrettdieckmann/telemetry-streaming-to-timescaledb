# Exploration of using Auto ARIMA model / forecasting in Python

Code demonstrates how to read in a CSV, perform minor data transformations, and generate a seasonal prediction. Also includes splitting data into a "training" and "testing" data set, where the "testing" data set can be used to verify the forecasted values.

## Running the code
```
python main.py
```
